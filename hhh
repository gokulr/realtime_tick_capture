Some of my goals (goals #3, #4 and #5) had already become sort of irrelevant by the time I had the mid-year conversation with Aris. This was either due to the reorganisation or attributed to de-prioritization of certain items in BOW. In such cases, I have written about the other projects that i have been involved in this year.

1. MD API/ MDSTATS
   - japan md api
   - shanghai md api
   - unit testing md api
   - mdstats migration to CTI
   - mdstats backfill for jp PTS data
   - introducing filtering for GW/RT

2. Enhance q knowledge and write better/efficient code

3. Password encryption and Audit remediation
   - This had been a major part of my work for the last two years. This year we had successfully closed the Audit CAP by encrypting passwords in all the packages/services in APAC. We had also completed this for some of the global code base - like dna q/java api, discovery, entitlement service, client alerts etc.
   - Before the last 3 weeks of CAP deadline, it was found that there was a production server in AUS that was RedHat4. It meant that we had to rebuild the old dna 3.2_I7 version with changes to C libraries as they were only compatible with RH5/6. During this last minute change, we were successfully able to create a new environment in hermes for RH4 and re-submit I7 version with necessary code changes; and eventually rollout to production without any issues.
   - Besides encryption, the other big portion of Audit CAP was retiring un-used FIDs. There were 160+ non-compliant FIDs that came up during the Audit review. We remediated all these over a span of two months.
   
4. TSE OSE merger phase 2
   - Estimated impact on marketdata feedhandler subscription and consolidated capture of derivatives marketdata into a single feedhandler
   - Added filter logic to MDSTATS GW to filter out derivatives data which helped reduce traffic between JP STI (where MDSTATS JP resides) to HK STI environment (where MDSTATS GW resides)
   - Analyzed impact on reference data for futures & options (exchange/market center etc) and how it affected downstream clients like OS and OC
   - Coordinated weekend testing for marketdata capture and RIO services for downstream subscribers like MOGA

5. Shanghai Connect
   - This project has been a great learning experience as it involved implementing the full stack of applications that we do as a team. This meant setting up feedhandlers to capture marketdata for the new market; and upon capture of raw data, implementing marketdata api based on the behaviour of exchnage (amopen/continuous/close and so). This also was the first time I had to implement mdapi from the scratch for any market. The knowledge gained here has been really valuable. After marketdata/ mdapi it was mdstats. This was 
   - mdstats/refdata/pt changes for mic code mapping
   - regional tca reporting backend/ jasperserver implementation
   - benchmark comparison between regional/global tca
   
6. EIC roll out for japan
  - Rolled out of EIC suite to JP
  - Involved setting up separate instance of EIC_CONFIG service for Japan - whose ric universe was just restricted to Tokyo symbols. This helped avoiding additional traffic between HK STI (where REFDATA resides) to JP STI (where MDSTATS resides)
  - Provided support for QA/production until the new dev team took over the project

7. JP server hardware migration
   - This project involved migration/retirement of applications from the old hardware in JP
   - Retired bars, sandbox and full depth marketdata capture from the old hardware after identifying that no one is using them
   - Set up the new hardware (including creation/raising of fid access for the team,firewall to STI,set up Autosys/ITRS and other DNA specific environment setup)
   - Created new license for RV daemon on the new h/w and migrated discovery to the new server

8. People strategy and reCET newsletter
   - Proactive and enthusiastic volunteer for organising people strategy events(culture stream) - POTLUCK Lunch
   - Delivering global CET newsletter (reCET) the last two years :) we come up with suggestions on various topics for the newsletter and reachout to appropriate person and draft the newsletter
   
9. Unit testing and BAND/DNA integration and GTCA - QA/Production release
